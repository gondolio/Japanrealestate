class RealEstateCalc:
    """
    Class to calculate economics of owning real estate in Japan as an individual (not a corporation)

        Excluded in this class:
            * Timings of cash flows (e.g. tax payments) and tax withholding are not considered.
            * Entrepreneurial Tax is not considered in this class. See for details:
              http://www.akasakarealestate.com/wiki/index.php/Taxes#Entrepreneurial_Tax
            * Corporate contracts, commercial real estate
            * Mid-year purchases and sales (there are rules about how various costs/taxes and how they are split, as
              well as depreciation complexities)
            * Corporate considerations (i.e. if you are a corporate rather than individual)
            * Exclusion of property tax for low value land and housing
            * Methods of calculating acquisition cost for capital gains (other than the actual acquisition cost) such
              as the approximate method etc (see http://investment-japan.jp/japantaxonproperty/2994.html for details)
            * Owning more than one non-investment property. In other words, this class assumes that if it is not
              your primary residence then it is an investment property (rather than a holiday home etc)
            * Tax for income made from primary residence (e.g. AirBnB).
            * Any tax laws that were only applicable prior to December 2016 (when this class was written)
            * Joint financing with another person (thus allowing you twice the home loan deduction), although joint
              ownership for capital gains tax reduction on primary residence is supported.
            * Any modeling of real estate yield changes over time (it assumes constant yield)

        Parameters associated with initial purchase:
        :param purchase_date: date when property was purchased. Defaults to date.today().
        :param purchase_price: Market value of property
        :param building_to_land_ratio: This breakdown is normally present in the real-estate contract or can be
               calculated from the "consumption tax" included in the price (as consumption tax doesn't apply on land).
               Default value is based on few examples found on the internet. Specify in decimal (i.e. 0.5 for 50%).
        :param size: Property size in square metres
        :param age: Property age in years.
               If zero, assumes property is new (i.e. not second hand).
        :param mortgage_loan_to_value: What % of the property value (as assessed by the bank) will be financed
               If zero, an all cash purchase is assumed. Specify in decimal (i.e. 0.8 for 80%).
        :param bank_valuation_to_actual: Bank assessed property value / actual market value. Specify in decimal.
        :param mortgage_tenor: Term of loan in years
        :param mortgage_rate: Annual interest rate. Specify in decimal (i.e. 0.01 for 1%).
        :param renovation_cost: Amount paid to renovate property after purchase.
        :param mortgage_initiation_fees: Sum of all fees paid for initiating mortgage
        :param agent_fee_variable: % of property market value paid to real estate agent. Specify in decimal.
        :param agent_fee_fixed: Other fees paid to agent on top of variable fees
        :param other_transaction_fees: Other fees paid to acquire/dispose real estate, in percentage of market value.
               Stamp duty, acquisition tax, judicial scrivener fee (incl. registration tax). Specify in decimal.

        Parameters associated with ongoing concern:
        :param monthly_fees: Monthly fees paid for management and sinking fund
        :param property_tax_rate: Annual taxes due on real estate, as % of purchase price. This is hard to estimate
               and should be obtained from agent. Specify in decimal (i.e. 0.01 for 1%).

               From http://www.akasakarealestate.com/wiki/index.php/Taxes#Possession_Tax:
               Normally about 0.3% to 0.5% of the market value each year, (peaks as high as 1.2%).

               This class could be expanded by taking in assessed value of property and calculating the tax but since
               the assessed value of property is obtained from a 3rd party (usually the agent?) that also would know
               the property_tax_rate, it is perhaps needlessly complicated. If we did want to do this, this link has
               the breakdown in the 'Holding' section: http://sumitomo-rd.com.sg/report03.php

        :param maintenance_per_m2: Amount paid annually per square metre.

               Default value of Â¥1000 taken from:
               http://www.asteriskrealty.jp/2009/07/27/average-maintenance-cost-of-residential-building-in-
               japanaverage-maintenance-cost-of-residential-building-in-japan/

        :param useful_life: Number of years it takes for a property's building book value to legally depreciate to zero
               from time of construction.

               Default value of 47 is for reinforced concrete, which is the norm for new properties.

               For more details, see:
               http://www.akasakarealestate.com/wiki/index.php/Taxes#Depreciation_Deduction_for_Income_Tax.

        :param income_tax_calculator: Instance of IncomeTaxCalc() class, instantiated based on user's tax profile.
               income_tax_calculator should be instantiated *excluding* the real estate income calculated in this class,
               since this class is used to calculate that income.

        :param calc_year: The year used when calculating net income and capital gains.
               A value of 0 means the net income and capital gains will be calculated for the same year as
               the purchase. A value of 1 means the following year, etc.

               Properties are bought at beginning of year and sold at end of year.
               So for example, calc_year=1 will simulate buying property and getting two years of rental income and
               then selling it.

               As with other fields, calculate_all_fields() should be called after this is changed.

        Parameters associated with renting out the real estate
        :param gross_rental_yield: Rental yield as % of purchase price, before any fees.
               If non-zero, the real estate will not necessarily be treated as investment property since yield is still
               achievable for primary residence (e.g. AirBnB). Note that AirBnB income for primary residence will be
               excluded from tax in this class.

        :param renewal_income_rate: If renting out the real estate, the % of annual rent the tenant pays when renewing
               or initiating contract. This can include key money. Specify in decimal.

               If None, defaults by assuming lease renewed every 2 years and one month rent is paid.

        :param rental_management_rental_fee: If renting out the real estate, the % of annual rent that the agent
               receives. Specify in decimal. Do not include consumption tax, this is handled later.

               If None, uses some sensible default.

        :param rental_management_renewal_fee: If renting out the real estate, the % of annual rent that the agent
               receives whenever a new tenant is found. Specify in decimal. Do not include consumption tax.

               If None, defaults by assuming lease renewed every 2 years with 50% of the time being a new tenant.

        Parameters associated with final disposal
        :param is_primary_residence: 0 if not, 1 if yes, 2 if jointly owned with spouse.
               If zero, will be treated as investment property for tax purposes.
        :param is_resident_for_tax_purposes: True if you are a resident of Japan for tax purposes, false otherwise.
        :param sale_price: Price of property sold. If None, will be estimated using depreciation model.
